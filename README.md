Synthetic Skin Lesion Data Generation for Darker Skin Tones: A Step Toward Reducing Racial Bias in AI.

Skin cancer detection models often underperform on patients with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. In this project, we address this disparity by training a StyleGAN3 model on the Fitz17k dataset, which includes a limited number of annotated skin cancer lesions for brown and dark skin tones. Our approach focuses on generating high-quality synthetic skin lesion images that represent diverse cancer types on darker skin tones. These synthetic images aim to augment existing datasets, reduce bias, and improve the performance and fairness of diagnostic models across all skin tones.
